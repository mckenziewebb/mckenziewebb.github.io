    <h3>I am a Junior Honors Computer Science Student here at A&T. I was born and raised Dallas, Texas where I
    played travel soccer for about 14 years. I also have a sister who is one year younger than me and she plays
    division one soccer at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am excited for this class, and to see what this school year
    has to offer!</h3>
